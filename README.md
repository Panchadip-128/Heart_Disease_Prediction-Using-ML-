# Heart_Disease_Prediction-Using-ML-
-------------------------------------

This repository contains code for training a logistic regression model to predict heart disease based on patient data.

## Dataset:
------------

The dataset used is `heart_disease_data.csv`, which contains various features related to patient health and a target variable indicating the presence of heart disease.

### Features:
--------------

- Age
- Sex
- Chest Pain Type (4 values)
- Resting Blood Pressure
- Serum Cholesterol in mg/dl
- Fasting Blood Sugar > 120 mg/dl
- Resting Electrocardiographic Results (values 0, 1, 2)
- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved
- Exercise-Induced Angina
- Oldpeak = ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest
- The Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment
- Number of Major Vessels (0-3) Colored by Flourosopy
- Thal (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect)

### Target:
------------

- 1: Defective Heart
- 0: Healthy Heart

## Prerequisites:
------------------

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn

You can install them using pip:

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
